    </div>

    <article>
        <p>An asthma action plan is a written document, developed in partnership with your healthcare provider, that outlines exactly what to do in three scenarios: when asthma is well controlled, when symptoms begin to worsen, and when a serious attack occurs. It sounds straightforward, yet research consistently shows that the majority of asthma patients do not have one. A 2020 analysis published in the Journal of Asthma found that only about 30 percent of adults with asthma reported having a written action plan.</p>

        <p>That gap has real consequences. The NHLBI considers written asthma action plans a standard of care because they reduce emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and missed days of work and school. They give patients the confidence to act quickly when symptoms change rather than waiting until a flare-up becomes a crisis.</p>

        <h2>The Traffic Light System</h2>

        <p>Most asthma action plans use a three-zone system modeled on a traffic light. Each zone corresponds to a level of asthma control and specifies which medications to take, when to take them, and when to seek medical help. The zones are defined by symptoms and, when available, by peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements taken with a portable peak flow meter.</p>

        <div class="zone-box zone-green">
            <h3>Green Zone: Doing Well</h3>
            <p>The green zone represents well-controlled asthma. Patients in this zone have no coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath. Sleep is uninterrupted by symptoms, and normal activities including exercise can be performed without difficulty. For those tracking peak flow, readings are 80 percent or more of their personal best.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue taking daily controller medications as prescribed</li>
                <li>Use rescue inhaler before exercise if directed</li>
                <li>Avoid known triggers</li>
                <li>Keep all follow-up appointments</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="zone-box zone-yellow">
            <h3>Yellow Zone: Getting Worse</h3>
            <p>The yellow zone is a warning stage. Symptoms include increased coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, nighttime awakening, or reduced activity tolerance. Peak flow readings fall between 50 and 80 percent of personal best. The yellow zone signals that airway inflammation is increasing and the current medication regimen is not providing adequate control.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take rescue inhaler (typically 2-4 puffs of albuterol)</li>
                <li>Add or increase controller medications as specified in your plan</li>
                <li>Your provider may prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids for this zone</li>
                <li>Continue monitoring symptoms and peak flow</li>
                <li>If symptoms do not improve within the timeframe specified in your plan (often 24-48 hours), contact your provider</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="zone-box zone-red">
            <h3>Red Zone: Medical Alert</h3>
            <p>The red zone indicates a serious asthma exacerbation. Symptoms are severe: significant shortness of breath, rescue inhaler provides less than four hours of relief or no relief at all, difficulty walking or talking due to breathlessness, or lips and fingernails appear bluish or gray. Peak flow is below 50 percent of personal best.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take rescue inhaler immediately (4-6 puffs; repeat every 20 minutes up to 3 times if needed)</li>
                <li>Take oral corticosteroids if prescribed for emergencies</li>
                <li>Call your doctor or go to the emergency department</li>
                <li>Call 911 if breathing difficulty is severe, lips are blue, or rescue inhaler is not helping</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Peak Flow Monitoring</h2>

        <p>Peak flow meters are inexpensive, portable devices that measure the fastest rate at which air can be expelled from the lungs. While not required for every patient, the NHLBI recommends peak flow monitoring for anyone with moderate to severe persistent asthma and for patients who have difficulty perceiving changes in their airway obstruction.</p>

        <p>To establish a meaningful baseline, patients should measure peak flow at the same time each day (usually morning before taking medications) over a two- to three-week period when asthma is well controlled. The highest reading during this period becomes the "personal best," and the three zones are calculated as percentages of that number.</p>

        <p>Peak flow monitoring is particularly valuable because airway narrowing often begins before a patient notices symptoms. A declining trend in peak flow readings over several days can provide an early warning that prompts yellow zone interventions before symptoms become severe. This proactive approach is one of the key advantages of having a structured action plan.</p>

        <h2>What Your Action Plan Should Include</h2>

        <p>A complete asthma action plan, as defined by the NHLBI and GINA guidelines, contains several essential elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patient's name, date, and healthcare provider's contact information</li>
            <li>A list of all current asthma medications with doses and frequencies</li>
            <li>Known triggers and avoidance strategies</li>
            <li>Green zone instructions: daily controller medications and pre-exercise medications</li>
            <li>Yellow zone instructions: specific medication adjustments, including which drugs to add and at what doses</li>
            <li>Red zone instructions: emergency medication doses and when to call 911</li>
            <li>Personal best peak flow value (if using peak flow monitoring)</li>
            <li>Emergency contact numbers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The plan should be specific. Vague instructions like "increase your medication" are not helpful during a stressful exacerbation. Instead, the plan should state exactly which medication, how many puffs or milligrams, how often, and for how long.</p>

        <h2>Making It Work in Practice</h2>

        <p>Having an action plan on paper is only useful if the patient and those around them know where it is and how to follow it. Keep copies in multiple locations: the refrigerator at home, a child's school health office, the workplace, and as a photo on your phone. For children, make sure all caregivers, teachers, coaches, and babysitters have a copy and understand its contents.</p>

        <p>The plan should be reviewed and updated at every regular asthma visit, typically every three to six months. Medication changes, new triggers, and shifts in asthma severity all require corresponding updates to the action plan. The GINA guidelines recommend that providers assess action plan understanding at each visit by asking the patient to explain what they would do in each zone.</p>

        <h2>Action Plans for Children</h2>

        <p>Children's action plans require additional considerations. Younger children cannot reliably assess their own symptoms or perform peak flow measurements, so parents and caregivers must be the primary interpreters of the plan. Schools in most states are required to allow students to carry and self-administer rescue inhalers, but this requires a physician's authorization and a copy of the action plan on file.</p>

        <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recommends involving children in their asthma management as they mature. By age seven or eight, most children can learn to identify their symptoms and use a peak flow meter with supervision. Teenagers should be transitioned toward independent self-management, with the action plan serving as a structured framework for decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Digital Tools and Apps</h2>

        <p>Several validated smartphone applications now allow patients to maintain digital action plans, log symptoms and peak flow readings, track medication adherence, and receive alerts when conditions suggest a zone change. The American Lung Association's "Lung HelpLine" and AAFA's "My Asthma App" are among the freely available tools. While digital tools can complement a written plan, they should not replace the paper document, which remains accessible during phone outages or when the patient is too ill to navigate an app.</p>

        <h2>The Evidence for Action Plans</h2>

        <p>A Cochrane systematic review encompassing 36 randomized controlled trials found that self-management education that included a written action plan, along with regular medical review and self-monitoring, reduced hospitalizations by 40 percent and emergency department visits by more than 20 percent compared with usual care. The benefits were consistent across age groups and asthma severity levels.</p>

        <p>If you do not currently have a written asthma action plan, bring this topic up at your next appointment. The NHLBI provides a free, downloadable action plan template at nhlbi.nih.gov that you and your provider can complete together. It takes about 15 minutes and could be one of the most impactful steps you take for your asthma management.</p>
