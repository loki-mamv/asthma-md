    <article>
        <p>Asthma does not behave the same way twelve months of the year. Seasonal shifts in temperature, humidity, pollen counts, air quality, and respiratory virus circulation create a constantly moving landscape of triggers. Many patients notice that their asthma follows a predictable annual pattern, with flare-ups clustering in certain months. Understanding these seasonal patterns allows for proactive adjustments to medication and behavior that can prevent exacerbations before they start.</p>

        <p>The CDC's surveillance data confirm that asthma-related emergency department visits follow clear seasonal trends. Pediatric visits spike in September, shortly after schools reopen. Adult visits peak during winter respiratory virus season. Spring and fall bring pollen- and mold-driven exacerbations. A year-round management approach accounts for all of these variations.</p>

        <h2>Spring: Pollen and Allergic Asthma</h2>

        <p>Spring is the most challenging season for the estimated 60 percent of asthma patients whose condition is driven by allergies. Tree pollens begin their release as early as February in warmer climates, followed by grass pollens from late spring through early summer. For allergic asthma patients, inhaling these proteins triggers an IgE-mediated inflammatory cascade that narrows the airways.</p>

        <p>Practical management during spring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor pollen counts through the National Allergy Bureau (aaaai.org/nab) or weather apps that include pollen data. Plan outdoor activities for lower-count days when possible.</li>
            <li>Keep windows closed at home and in the car. Use air conditioning with clean filters rather than opening windows for ventilation.</li>
            <li>Shower and change clothes after prolonged outdoor exposure to remove pollen from skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Consider starting or increasing controller medication two to four weeks before your historically worst season begins. This is sometimes called "seasonal step-up therapy" and is endorsed by the GINA guidelines for patients with predictable seasonal patterns.</li>
            <li>Discuss allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual tablets) with an allergist if seasonal symptoms are severe despite medication. Immunotherapy modifies the underlying allergic response and has been shown in clinical trials to reduce asthma symptoms and medication requirements over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Summer: Heat, Ozone, and Thunderstorms</h2>

        <p>Summer brings a different set of challenges. Ground-level ozone, formed when sunlight reacts with vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, peaks during hot, sunny days. Ozone is a potent airway irritant even in healthy individuals; for people with asthma, elevated ozone exposure increases inflammation, reduces lung function, and raises the risk of exacerbation. The EPA classifies ozone levels above 100 on the Air Quality Index as "unhealthy for sensitive groups," a category that explicitly includes asthma patients.</p>

        <p>High heat and humidity also affect breathing. Humid air is denser and can feel harder to breathe, particularly during exertion. Some patients find that very high humidity worsens symptoms, while others are more affected by sudden shifts between air-conditioned indoor environments and hot outdoor air.</p>

        <p>Thunderstorm asthma deserves specific attention. During certain thunderstorms, strong downdrafts and electrical activity can rupture pollen grains and fungal spores into microscopic fragments small enough to penetrate deep into the lower airways. Major thunderstorm asthma events have been documented in Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, and North America. Patients with both asthma and grass pollen allergy are at highest risk. On days when thunderstorms are forecast during high pollen season, staying indoors with windows closed is the most effective precaution.</p>

        <p>Summer management strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the AQI daily at airnow.gov. On high-ozone days, exercise indoors or during early morning hours when ozone levels are lowest.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated. Dehydration can thicken airway mucus and make symptoms worse.</li>
            <li>If using a pool for exercise, choose well-ventilated or outdoor pools to minimize chloramine exposure.</li>
            <li>Be aware of thunderstorm forecasts during pollen season and adjust plans accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fall: The September Epidemic and Mold</h2>

        <p>Pediatric asthma specialists have long recognized a phenomenon called the "September epidemic," a sharp increase in childhood asthma exacerbations that occurs two to three weeks after the school year begins. The primary driver appears to be rhinovirus (common cold) transmission in school settings. Children bring the virus home, and family members with asthma are affected as well.</p>

        <p>Research published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology has shown that this fall surge is so predictable that some clinicians advocate a proactive increase in controller medication during late August and September. The NHLBI guidelines support stepping up therapy during periods of known increased risk.</p>

        <p>Fall also brings elevated mold spore counts. Decaying leaves, damp soil, and agricultural harvests release large quantities of outdoor mold spores, particularly Alternaria and Cladosporium species. Alternaria sensitivity has been identified as a specific risk factor for severe asthma attacks in multiple epidemiologic studies.</p>

        <p>Fall management strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure controller medications are being taken consistently before the school year starts. Do not wait for symptoms to resume before restarting a lapsed regimen.</li>
            <li>Emphasize hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette with children returning to school.</li>
            <li>Get the annual influenza vaccine as early as it becomes available, typically by September or October.</li>
            <li>Rake leaves while wearing a mask or assign the task to a non-asthmatic family member. Disturbing leaf piles releases concentrated mold spores.</li>
            <li>Keep gutters clean and manage yard drainage to reduce mold growth near the home.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Winter: Cold Air and Respiratory Viruses</h2>

        <p>Winter presents a dual challenge: cold air itself triggers bronchoconstriction, and the season brings peak circulation of influenza, RSV, and other respiratory viruses. Viral infections are the single most common cause of severe asthma exacerbations across all age groups. The combination of cold air exposure and active respiratory infection can produce particularly severe attacks.</p>

        <p>Cold air triggers asthma through the same mechanism as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: heat and water loss from the airway surface. The drier the air, the more pronounced the effect. Indoor heating systems further reduce ambient humidity, creating dry conditions both inside and outside the home.</p>

        <p>Winter management strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Breathe through the nose when outdoors. Nasal passages warm and humidify air far more effectively than the mouth.</li>
            <li>Wear a scarf or cold-weather mask over the nose and mouth during outdoor activities in cold weather.</li>
            <li>Use a humidifier indoors to maintain humidity between 30 and 50 percent. Clean the humidifier regularly to prevent mold and bacterial growth.</li>
            <li>Stay current on vaccinations: influenza annually, COVID-19 boosters as recommended, and pneumococcal vaccines if indicated by age or comorbidities.</li>
            <li>Have a plan for viral illnesses. Many action plans include instructions for increasing controller medication at the first sign of a cold, before asthma symptoms begin to escalate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Year-Round Foundations</h2>

        <p>Regardless of the season, certain practices form the backbone of effective asthma management:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take controller medications daily as prescribed, even when symptoms are absent. The anti-inflammatory effect is cumulative and preventive.</li>
            <li>Keep your rescue inhaler accessible at all times. Check expiration dates periodically.</li>
            <li>Maintain a written asthma action plan and review it with your provider at least every six months.</li>
            <li>Track symptoms in a diary or app. Seasonal patterns become visible over time and allow you to anticipate rather than react.</li>
            <li>Address indoor air quality year-round: no smoking indoors, regular HVAC filter changes, and control of dust mites and pet dander.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Discussing your seasonal pattern with your healthcare provider enables anticipatory adjustments. Some patients benefit from a scheduled step-up in controller therapy during their historically worst season and a step-down during their best. This approach, supported by GINA and NHLBI guidelines, turns seasonal management from reactive to strategic.</p>
